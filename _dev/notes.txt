check
 ? remove: npm install --save autosuggest-highlight
 ? restrict google maps api (ip, or other?)



 Decisions.
 Autocomplete
  - GeoDB was find
  - Google is super polisched
   -- it was more complicated (two apis: maps, places; bit of navigating google cloud)
   -- interfaciing with the MUI example was pretty involved. e.g. I wanted to limited 'cities'
      -- review the model

 Call API client side rather than server side, to avoide extra hop

 - exposing sensitve data to the client in favor of performance
